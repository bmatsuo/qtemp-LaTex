qtemp-LaTex - A collection of LaTex templates for qtemp
Written by Bryan Matsuo <bryan.matsuo@gmail.com>

This is a collection of templates to easily generate empty LaTex documents,
headers/footers, titles, and bibtex bibliography entries.

To install these templates, place them in directory "~/.qtemp/templates/LaTex/".

Then just use qtemp to generate templates.

    qtemp tex -o new.tex

And in vim, while editing 'new.tex'

    V!qtemp tex-headfoot

Now you have a header and footer.

Tada!
